# Project 2

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript
----------------------------------------------------------
This Project implement Websocket techology
Its implemented three templates, one as layout and the other as what the user will see
On the front page shows a login, where the user must provide a nickname, then it would be redirected to 
the chat room in which it is inmediately added to the General Channel
The user has the option to add more channels and simultaneously send messages in the current channel or the other 
channeles where is a member.
----------------------------------------------------------
As an observations, at this level the webchat page is functional, it has already bugs, for example, the scrollbar 
for the messages container is not yet implemented also it looks quite messy the frontend!
The application.py and socket implementation works fine but not precisely.
----------------------------------------------------------
As a personal touch add some icons and hover over the icons, I have not yet implmented the night mode
As some others implementation for first time I kow how to use a modal.

Thanks to my tutor Axel Darce :)
